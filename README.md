## We take care of the exhibitions of TOMORROW

Hello and welcome. We are very happy that you are visiting our GitHub page. Our product will make your exhibition shine in a new light. This page introduces our product and contains a short information about the challenge with DB Connect - Call A Bike. Enjoy your visit!

## The problem

- How might get visitors (young adults) more excited about exhibitions?
- How might we guide visitors (young adults) through an exhibition in an interactive and playful way?

## The solution

Our solution is designed to guide visitors through the exhibition in a playful and interactive way. For this purpose we have developed Scan Game. Everywhere in the exhibition in QR codes hidden, which must be found by the visitor. Behind each QR code hides a mini-game.

## Why SCAN GAME

- Easy access for visitors by using their own device
- Visitors are guided through the exhibition in an interactive and playful way
- Visitors will be excited and experience the exhibition in a whole new way
